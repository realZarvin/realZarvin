## About Me

Iâ€™m a co-founder of Midas Labs, an onchain research & development lab focused on building cutting-edge Solana trading tools. We take existing trading strategies, optimize them for efficiency, and develop new methods to gain a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving onchain landscape. Our core philosophy is simple: tools first, protocols laterâ€”we build practical, high-performance solutions before scaling them into full-fledged systems.

# What Weâ€™re Building

Weâ€™re developing a gamification system that rewards users for smart trading decisions, enhances engagement, and creates a structured approach to risk management. Imagine unlocking new tools, increasing buying power, and gaining exclusive advantages based on your performance.
