## About Me
ðŸ”¹ Onchain Researcher | Trader | Builder

I specialize in onchain trading, research, and automation, constantly exploring new ways to refine trading strategies and optimize execution on Solana. My approach is rooted in data, efficiency, and innovationâ€”whether it's automating trades, tracking wallet activity, or developing tools that give traders an edge.

As the founder of Midas Labs, my focus is on redefining onchain edge by experimenting with new methodologies, minimizing inefficiencies, and creating advanced trading solutions. I believe in building tools first, protocols laterâ€”prioritizing real, practical advantages before scaling into broader systems..

# My Mindset

I see crypto as more than just an asset classâ€”itâ€™s a constantly evolving competitive landscape where efficiency, automation, and adaptability determine success.
