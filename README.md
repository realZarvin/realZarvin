## About Me
ðŸ”¹ Onchain Researcher | Trader | Builder

I thrive at the intersection of trading, automation, and research, constantly pushing the limits of what's possible in onchain markets. My approach is built on efficiency, data, and execution, always looking for ways to refine strategies, minimize downside, and maximize edge.

As a memecoin trader, Iâ€™ve learned to detach from the noise and gamify the processâ€”turning what many see as chaos into a structured, strategic experience. I believe that in markets driven by speed and sentiment, the real advantage comes from objectivity, adaptability, and execution.

Beyond trading, Iâ€™m an experimenter and builder. I donâ€™t settle for theoretical edgesâ€”I test, iterate, and optimize until I find what actually works. Whether itâ€™s through automation, new methodologies, or innovative frameworks, Iâ€™m always looking for ways to stay ahead of the curve and help others do the same.

I donâ€™t just participate in onchain marketsâ€”I work to reshape them.
